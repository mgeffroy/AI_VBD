# AI_VBD
This is the code made to make an exploratory search for bibliographical references about the use of Artificial intelligence (AI) in different areas to control and surveil Vector-Borne diseases. <br>
The code accesses the Entrez Programming Utilities (E-utilities): a public API from the NCBI (US) that allows access to different databases In this case access to PubMed was the main target.
I retrieved data from the API about different vector-borne diseases, a specific AI technique and the objective for the use of these techniques (diagnostic, surveillance, forecasting, and early warning systems)
